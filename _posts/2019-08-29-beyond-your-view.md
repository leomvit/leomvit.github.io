Glance up at the night sky,  
Be it any night, any city,  
Town or park,  
Don't you see?  
There's a whole land out there.

A place where stars keep shining  
And everything that happens  
Is orderly, organized  
And professionally assembled.  

Look out, and you will see  
God's Creations, if not Himself in them.  
This, is where you, we have  
Come from since the beginning.  

Look up above,  
Any night, any time,  
You'll see the world, life  
And all it's secrets.  

Like a key necklace,  
Looped around Jupiter's neck  
And resting on Neptune,  
Shining brighter than the Sun itself.  

Once you peer a look at this,  
God's Original world,  
You can see all  
That your heart and mind desire  
And all that your heart and mind need.
