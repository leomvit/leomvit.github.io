**STORY OF SKIN**  

I have skin.<br/>
The skin that carries my story,<br/>
The story of my scars, <br/>
The story of my tans,<br/>
Some scars they fade away with time but some don't, they remain forever<br/>
But the pain of each and every scar fades with time no matter how deep it is, pain will eventually be gone<br/>
And with time you get comfortable in your scarred skin that becomes part of your story <br/>
The people around, who truly and deeply understand you, will accept your scars and will never make you feel any different.<br/>


Now, the scar is fresh it will hurt  <br/>
But time will take away the pain I know one day<br/> 
Maybe someday<br/>


Now, the scar is old,<br/> 
I am looking at my skin, <br/>
I saw the scar that once used to be fresh and used to hurt<br/>
Now, it's just a humble reminder that I have grown stronger and acceptance is the way I live<br/>


One day I died, <br/>
All my skin emerged with something unknown and then all the story that I made is forgotten<br/> 
It is forgotten NOW.<br/>
