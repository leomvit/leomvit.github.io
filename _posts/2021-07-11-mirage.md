<strong>L<br />et the stone,</strong><br />
to create ripple in water.<br />
Why are you justifying?<br />

We are drenching  in dark emotions,<br />
deeply and drastically.<br />
Why are we drifting it down.<br />
Here and there it's mirage everywhere,<br />
sometimes day or sometimes dark night,<br />
and sometime struggling with  bad rhymes.<br />
Isn't there some anomaly ,<br />
Why is it roaring too loud?<br />

My thoughts are shivering.<br />
My motivation moves from fire to cold.<br />
I saw that stone falling down.<br />
Again I fell for the mirage.<br />
Hoping this to be better or a sucessful battle.<br />
It turned out, I am failing down.<br />
Why this mirage keeps me crawling?<br />
