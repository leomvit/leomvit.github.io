excerpt: "When life hits you hard. I lay in my bed. Can't sleep, too much in my head. Water in my eyes. What a world of lies. Don't worry I am fine. Just give me another bottle of wine."

I lay in my bed  
Can't sleep, too much in my head  
Water in my eyes   
What a world of lies  

Don't worry I am fine   
Just give me another bottle of wine   
Not even a single smile   
In this rotten life of mine  

Should I end it  
Where's the knife   
Can't find it  
Wanna end my life  

I too wanted to live life fullest   
But Tears I shed  
I just need a bullet  
Through my head  

Tomorrow will not be the same   
No more of this pain  
One should never live in vain'   

Found the knife..

**Let's end the game**
