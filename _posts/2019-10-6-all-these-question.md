what lies in the halls of the imagination 

And lingers in the depths of the soul?

What if thoughts could foster a nation

And words could make me whole…?

When light ceases to exists what will the world hold…

Will darkness consume everything?

Leaving the oceans lonely and cold.

Will the moon crash down from the sky?

Will the birds still fly?

These questions I cannot answer.

Though my wondering mind wants it to be so.

These thoughts are a deadly cancer.

And I realize, I may never know.
