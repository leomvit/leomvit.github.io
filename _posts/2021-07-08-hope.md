**HOPE**


At dusk, with a gloomy face<br/>
Awestruck thoughts as I sit ashore<br/>
Guilt and pain, tough row to hoe<br/>
Strange whisper to curse god, for sure<br/>

Clouds that cover the sunshine<br/>
Struggling what I can to survive the hell<br/>
Full of sorrow with my lonely world<br/>
As no one cares , surely can tell<br/>

In the midst of dark , I close eyes<br/>
Feel the heart whose love is innocent<br/>
Reminisce about past , the joy of bloom<br/>
Stairs to heaven , for me , to ascend<br/>

With deep breath , I stand again<br/>
Tear the tears for incredible scope<br/>
With warm heart and a little smile<br/>
I leave the shore , for a better life , in ‘HOPE’<br/>
