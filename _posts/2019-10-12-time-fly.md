        There will be a day
        When the time will make you realise
        Words will fall short
        And the moments will be lost
        That moment wonâ€™t have time
        And have no wishes
        Only the realisation that
        You have lost something
        Something that was very precious 
        Something you could have saved forever
        So leave saving money
        And start spending
        Start exploring everything 
        And start searching for new things
        Start laughing loudly 
        And start living lively
        Cause time has wings and 
        It will fly
