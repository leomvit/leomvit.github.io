**_There will be a day_**
   When the time will make you realise
   Words will fall short
   And the moments will be lost
   That moment wonâ€™t have time
   And have no wishes
   Only the realisation that
   You have lost something
   Something that was very precious 
   Something you could have saved forever
   So leave saving money
   And start spending
   Start exploring everything 
   And start searching for new things
   Start laughing loudly 
   And start living lively
   **_Cause time has wings and_** 
   **_It will fly_**
