**_There will be a day_**
When the time will make you realise
Words will fall short
And the moments will be lost
That moment won’t have time
And have no wishes
Only the realisation that
You have lost something
Something that was very precious 
Something you could have saved forever
So leave saving money
And start spending
Start exploring everything 
And start searching for new things
Start laughing loudly 
And start living lively
**_Cause time has wings and_** 
**_It will fly_**
