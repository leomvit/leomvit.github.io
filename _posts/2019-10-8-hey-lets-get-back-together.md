<br />
So far but still close, <br />
Every day without you, the time flows. <br />
A minute without you isn't calm, <br />
Hey, let's get back together,  my MOM. <br />


<br />
You are like me but smart, <br />
I miss you from the bottom of my heart. <br />
Let's combat again with one another, <br />
Hey, let's get back together, my BROTHER. <br />


<br />
Life lessons that you taught, <br />
You inspired me a lot. <br />
Without you, I wouldn't be the person so steady, <br />
Hey, let's get back together, my DADDY. <br />
