excerpt: "Like a book,

I have a beginning, I have an end

Whatever the story is, whatever is me

You won't really know"

Like a book,

I have a beginning, I have an end

Whatever the story is, whatever is me

You won't really know

unless the content you see

Like a book,

I am criticized, I am appreciated

I am loved, I am hated

I'm not perfect but I'm good

But still I need revisions

from time to time

Like a book,

I am filled with words waiting to be read

I am not a blank sheet waiting to be inked

Read me! Read me!

Take me off the bookshelf in the library
