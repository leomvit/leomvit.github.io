**Oblivion**  

O' waves take me away<br/>
To the land of salvation<br/>
I stand here by the bay<br/>
Waiting with all my patience<br/>
You don't judge, I've heard<br/>
Taking all boats with you<br/>
I'm a lonely one keeping my word<br/>
Expecting from only a few<br/>

O' waves you calm minds<br/>
Your splashes speaks silence<br/>
Is it where the man finds?<br/>
The quest for his semblance<br/>
The winds overpowering the will<br/>
The rocks stern as demur<br/>
Tell me do I stand here still? <br/>
Or wait for a miracle to occur<br/>

O' waves I've travelled this far<br/>
All I have is my deeds<br/>
Time has left me a scar<br/>
See your water recedes!<br/>
Are you going to tell me my fate?<br/>
Or you're too stuck in oblivion<br/>
