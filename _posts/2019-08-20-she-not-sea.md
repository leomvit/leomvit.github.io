I have/had a problem.  
Called it a misfeature.  
I guess all humans have faced  
In days of their miniature.  
Some for few days, few for no days.  
And like me  
some got no end days.  
Stammering, stuttering, sound disorder  
used to be called.  
But, once you grow up  
'Mispronunciation' term oust these all.

I asked them once,  
"Where is sea".  
They glared, asked if I meant  
"Where is she".  
To reciprocate not abnormally,  
I asked again.  
"Where in shitty"?  
They corrected, said  
"In city, not shitty".  
I nodded, I had to.  
And went on rehearsing those words  
like a nursery kid.  
They smiled on me, I on myself.

It was once an election season.  
I was sitting on sofa,  
Indulged in Dinning room conversation.  
TV in front bombarded with poll results,  
When I asked my cousin  
'If he boted last year'?  
Since he has been away  
from hometown for years.  
He said,  
"Didn't bot, but voted last year".  
Funnier goes there,  
Here embarrassment sighed.

When come to nicknames,  
My scenario goes different.  
My friends say,  
I carry their names wrong.  
So instead,  
they give nicknames to themselves  
Which don't carry letters  
which anymore don't make  
them and me feel shy.

Even today, when I go to  
Any utensils' store.  
Before asking for a Jug  
I mutter inside my mouth  
a lot.  
Only not to make myself  
Appear as Zug.
