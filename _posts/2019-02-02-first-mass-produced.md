excerpt: [ when life hits u hard ]
---
I lay in my bed  
Can't sleep, too much in my head  
Water in my eyes   
What a world of lies  

Don't worry I am fine   
Jst give me another bottle of wine   
Not even a single smile   
In this rotten life of mine  

Shld i end it  
Where's the knife   
Can't find it  
Wanna end my life  

I too wanted to live life fullest   
But Tears i shed  
I jst need a bullet  
Through my head  


Tomorrow ll not be the same   
Nomore of the pain  
One shld not live in vain  

**Found the knife .**  

**lets end the game**
