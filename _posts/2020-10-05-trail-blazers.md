**Birds, thoughts are mere birds**  
Flying fervently, striking recklessly  
Birds going crazy, screaming and screeching  
To break this cage, this cage of captivity  

Restless inside, breathless outside  
Thousands of birds stuck in my mind  
Yearning to fly, to touch the sky  
To enlighten the world, they unite  

And when the birds come out,  
Come out and touch unfathomable heights  
They realise, the captivity was worth it  
A fuel to their flight  

Truth be told, they were not mere birds  
Mere birds to come out and fly  
They were TRAIL BLAZERS,  
They were a beacon of light.
