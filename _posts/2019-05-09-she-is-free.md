She's a wild flower, they said, as free as the wind,  
She dances to the rhythm of the rain,  
<<<<<<< HEAD
and to the mountains, she sings.  
=======
and to the mountains, she sings.

>>>>>>> upstream/master
Little do they realize, she dances to fly away,  
searching for a crack somewhere in the blue sky,  
to step into a parallel world run by dreams,  
where her feet aren't bound by reality and  
<<<<<<< HEAD
love doesn't cost her peace.  
=======
love doesn't cost her peace.

>>>>>>> upstream/master
Her songs weren't just music to the ears,  
she sang to the universe,  
her voice healing broken hearts,  
filling those deep crevices with stardust,  
<<<<<<< HEAD
turning them into art.  
She's like a fire fly they said  
and loved to watch her glow,  
If only they'd come closer,they'd realise that she was a galaxy,  
and could light up the world on her own.  
She could tame her the spirits,they said,take cover as the winds  
were rough,  
She was like a wild flower remember,too gentle for the world.  
However, she was the storm,  
if only they care to understand her enough.
