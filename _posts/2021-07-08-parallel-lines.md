<strong>i<br />ntersecting highways under the city lights<br /></strong>
telling us that we're black and white<br />
take this road with the essence of the night<br />
all our paths crossed but we were parallel lines<br />

yellow burns, as we move ahead<br />
images burnt, as they haunt our heads<br />
the pain unhurt, as the words were fed<br />
we never lost, it was all bright and red<br />

destinies aligned, stay with me, just sit<br />
our colours combined, heartbreak was a myth<br />
thoughts resigned, this ending was so fit<br />
to realise we were parallel lines to begin with<br />
