LEO
**"Lets express ourselves"** just as the name
suggest. This club basically is for the people to
find their true self and learning to voice their
thoughts. We not only improve a person as a
speaker but develops the entire personality of

the person as whole. We have knowledge feeds for
members so that they stay updated to latest
news. We also have word of the day that
improves vocabulary in the process. Here in the

sessions events like debate, group discussions
and mock placements helps you to improve in
professional communication. As per the
records, Leonites have been the first ones to get

placed during the recruitment process every
year. Apart from this, we also have many fun
events like turn coat debate, **aircrash** and **mad

ads** which acts as a breather from the mundane
college routine. We have lots of fun moments in
which beautiful memories are made and
friendships are cherished. we have an annual

L.E.O trip to take a break and explore other
amazing places. LEO has been actively
participating in various college fests in and
around Bengaluru which take place at the state
and national levels. We have also won prizes in
many intercollegiate events. Our main motto has

always been **"be brave be loud"**  
 and  


**we work together to achieve it.**

together to achieve it.
